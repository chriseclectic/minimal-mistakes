## QuantumUtils

I am one of the lead developers of <a href="http://quantumutils.cjwood.com" target="_blank">*QuantumUtils for Mathematica*</a>: a *Mathematica* software library for symbolic and numerical simulations of quantum systems, and various tools useful for quantum information science.

Some features of this library include:

* *Multi-partite tensor manipulations.*
* *Quantum system modeling including qudits, circuits, spins, and cavities.*
* *Symbolic Lie algebra simplification for spin and cavity systems.*
* *Quantum channels in multiple representations.*
* *Numerical and symbolic simulators for open and closed quantum system evolution.*
* *An implementation of GRadient Ascent Pulse Engineering including distortions.*
* *Perturbative expansion tools such as the Magnus series, the Zassenhaus formula, and matrix power series*
* *Visualization functions for displaying matrices, quantum states, data etc.*
