 My ongoing research interests are:

 * To develop new theoretical techniques for the characterization of large, non-Markovian open quantum systems.

 * To explore new applications of open systems theory and dissipative dynamics for performing useful information processing tasks in hybrid quantum systems.

 * To apply these techniques to enable new quantum technologies.


## Specific Projects

#### Cavity Cooling of an Ensemble Quantum System

#### Quantum Superchannels for Characterizing Non-Markovian systems

#### Quantum Information Approach to Neutron Inteferometry

#### Graphical Calculus and Tensor Networks for Open Quantum Systems

#### Causal Inference for Quantum Correlations
